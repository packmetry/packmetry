# Packmetry Implementation Log

Keep this short and factual. This is a continuation aid, not product authority.

## 2026-09-19 — Clean Packmetry repository foundation prepared

### Completed
- Created clean Packmetry authority structure.
- Preserved the Packmetry bootstrap as highest project authority.
- Preserved the detailed CartonLab specification only as subordinate legacy product detail.
- Excluded obsolete CartonLab Cline bootstrap/rules/log/ADR files from active authority to prevent instruction mixing.
- Added Packmetry-specific Cline rules, security rules, review workflow, `.gitignore`, and `.clineignore`.
- Preserved the supplied old CartonLab HTML only as a legacy visual artifact, not active design authority.

### Current stage
Phase 0 — repository and governance foundation.

### Next step
Review this foundation locally, then create/connect the empty GitHub `packmetry` repository. Do not begin application implementation until the foundation is accepted.

## 2026-09-19 — PKM-BOOT-002: Production codebase skeleton established

### Completed
- Initialized Astro project in existing repository (not nested)
- Configured: Astro 7.3.3 + React integration + TypeScript strict mode + Vitest
- Established maintainable source structure:
  ```
  src/
  ├── components/
  ├── layouts/
  ├── pages/
  ├── core/
  │   ├── domain/
  │   ├── units/
  │   ├── solver/
  │   └── verification/
  └── test/
  ```
- Created minimal placeholder index page proving Astro runs (only simple Packmetry identification text)
- Created package scripts: dev, build, test, typecheck (astro check)
- Updated .gitignore for Vitest cache (.vitest/)
- Preserved all governance/docs files and browser-first architecture

### Corrections Applied
- Changed `typecheck` script from `tsc --noEmit` to Astro-aware `astro check`
- Added `@astrojs/check` dependency
- Removed unused foundation dependencies: @vitest/ui, @vitest/coverage-v8, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, jsdom, jest-environment-jsdom
- Removed `.env.example` (no required configuration)

### Validation Results
- ✅ npm install: Success (with 1 deprecated dependency warning)
- ✅ npm run typecheck: Success (astro check passes)
- ✅ npm test: Success (2 example tests pass)
- ✅ npm run build: Success (1 page built successfully)

### Files Created
- `package.json` with configured dependencies
- `astro.config.mjs` with React integration
- `tsconfig.json` with strict mode and path aliases
- `vitest.config.ts` with test configuration
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`
- `src/pages/index.astro` (placeholder page)
- `src/test/setup.ts`
- `src/test/example.test.ts`

### Files Modified
- `.gitignore` (added .vitest/)
- `package.json` (updated scripts and dependencies)
- `docs/logs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md` (this entry)

### Dependencies Added
- Production: astro, @astrojs/react, react, react-dom
- Development: typescript, vitest, @astrojs/check, @types/react, @types/react-dom, @types/node

### Known Issues
- 1 deprecated dependency warning (glob@10.5.0)
- 2 moderate severity vulnerabilities reported by npm audit (reduced from 4)
- No actual packing functionality implemented yet (as per scope)

### Next Recommended Task
PKM-CORE-001: Implement canonical units and dimensions system (first dependency-correct module)
